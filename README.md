<h1 align="center">ISgood Bot</h1>

As of the 6th of April 2022 I (acatia) have decided to revive ISgood bot. I announced that I would be discontinuing it on the 25th of October 2021. After a big break from working on it, I decided that I want restart ISgood bot, but this time I decided to make the source code **public**. I'm not a fan of closed source projects as people are unable to see what the bot "actually does" (I.E if the bot does malicious things without people knowing). Also, I want this to be a project that other people can contribute on.

**This repository** will be where the source code for the bot will be kept. *Some* of the code will be from the old version of the bot.

At the time of announcing this, the bot won't be available to add to your server as it's under development.

Thanks,
acatia
